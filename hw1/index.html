		<h2>Overview</h2>

		<p>In this assignment, we implemented a simple triangle rasterizer using three line testing and antialiased these triangles using a supersampling algorithm. We additionally implemented basic hierarchical transformations for 2D coordinate systems (rotation, scaling, and translation) to manipulate shapes composing a human-shaped robot. We also created a barycentric coordinate algorithm to 
			create smooth color transitions between points with defined colors. We did not have enough time to implement texture mapping by pixel sampling and level sampling with mipmaps. </p>
		
		<h2>Task 1: Drawing Single-Color Triangles</h2>
		<p> First, we create the boundary box for the triangle: we find the largest x,y values and the smallest x,y values of our triangle, and this determines the range of values we’ll be testing within our for loop. Inside this for loop, we use three different line equations (each correlating with the three total pairs of points) and test it against our x and y values. 
		If it fails any of the three tests, this point is not rendered. If all three tests are passed, then the point is rendered. Our three line tests in reality are six different booleans, the first three defined as the results of the line test being greater than or equal to 0, and the latter three defined as the results of the line test being less than 0. 
		We have these two sets of booleans as the triangle’s winding order may be counterclockwise or clockwise, meaning that pixels that should be colored may be all &gt; =0 or &gt; 0, respectively. Our algorithm is no worse than one that checks each sample within the bounding box because that is exactly what our algorithm does: it only checks points within the bounding box, 
		as points outside of the boundary have no need to be checked as passing the three line test. We defined the boundary box as the smallest x & y values and the largest x & y values within the three points of the triangle. </p>

			checked as passing the three line test. We defined the boundary box as the smallest x/y values and the largest x/y values within the three points of the triangle. </p>

		<h2>Task 2: Antialiasing by Supersampling</h2>
		<p> In rasterize_triangle, we modified our original for loop to ignore the boundary box. While we lose the efficiency of being able to skip unnecessary pixels, it was slightly easier for us to avoid indexing bugs while going from the low-res frame buffer to the high-res samplebuffer. Additionally, instead of calling fill_pixel, we index into sample_buffer 
			ourselves (after ensuring that it’s resized after a sample rate increase within set_samplebuffer) and populate it with sums of the floats returned from our three line tests multiplied by color.  
		</p>

		<p> In resolve_to_framebuffer, we go from high res back to high res. Inside our double for loop with the width and height of the samplebuffer, we have another double for loop that skips through each 4x4 set of pixels (given a sample rate of 16, for example) and averages their color. 
			By dividing our samplebuffer indices by the square rate of our sample rate, we get the index to the corresponding framebuffer pixel. Within this pixel, we color given the average—supersampling is useful for this reason as we can color in pixels not with an absolute value, but with an opacity that reflects its position within the triangle, 
			instead of not colored at all (which leaves confusing or unappealing gaps within our triangle).

		<h2>Task 3: Transforms</h2>
		<p> We tried to make the cubeman look like he was walking towards us with his leg raised, and also slightly confused and slightly lilac.

		<h2>Task 4: Barycentric coordinates</h2>
		<p> Given some set of specific values at vertices, barycentric coordinates help us to get smoothly varying values across some surface by interpolating the values. As is the case with the image on the right, given a triangle with a red, blue, and green vertex, barycentric coordinates allow us to interpolate the color values of other pixels within the triangle to smoothly blend the colors. 
		</p>
		We generate the rays within generate_ray by first, translating our given field of view angles (hFov and vFov) into radians. We then use these numbers to create our x and y sensor positions, which are inputted into our camera space 3D vector. To create our world space 3D vector, we multiply rCamSpace by our camera-to-world rotation matrix. Finally, we generate our ray by using ‘pos’ as our origin, and our world space vector as our direction (as well as setting the ray’s max and min intersection t). In pathtracer, we average the global illumination of each ray given the number of samples to create different color values around 3D objects in our render. 
		
		<p>
		The primitive intersection is implemented by calculating the intersection of a given ray and a primitive with the normal vector of the plane (our primitive) and barycentric coordinates of our triangle vertices—if the intersection is above the min_t and max_t of a ray, or within the viewable bounds, the intersection will be rendered. Otherwise, our intersect function will return false.
		</p>

		<p>
		We implemented the ray-triangle intersection algorithm by using Moller Trumbore Algorithm: we first calculate the two segments of the triangle, which are cross multiplied by the ray’s direction and the normal vector of the plane, respectively. Then, we can calculate t by dividiing 1.0 by the dot products of our cross product results and our segments. If t is less than 0 or min_t, or greater than max_t, it is not visible and shouldn’t be rendered, so Triangle::intersect returns false. Otherwise, we calculate other values relevant to the intersection to render the illumination accurately, including surface normal at the intersection (w/ barycentric coordinates).

		<h2>Task 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h2>
		<p>Though we did not have enough time to properly implement pixel sampling for texture mapping, we would begin to approach pixel sampling by using the nearest pixel given some texel point. For bilinear filtering, we would take 4 nearest sampled pixel locations given some texel point and calculate the lerp to linearly interpolate the texture of that point. </p>

		<h2>Task 6: "Level Sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h2>
		<p>Though we did not have enough time to properly implement “Level sampling” with mipmaps, we would ideally have implemented a system that would firstly–given lsm, would return the appropriate mipmap level by calculating either the nearest mipmap level or by calculating the mipmap level as a continuous number and consequently a weighted sum of sampled adjacent levels, 
			secondly–would have a helper function for the previous goal that would return the barycentric coordinates and their respective derivations as a scaled vectors given dimensions of the image.</p>
